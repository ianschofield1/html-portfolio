<h2>Ian's Top 3 Movies to Watch</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
  This movie is put together incredibly well and graps all of the viewers
  emotions in just 2 hours. From the dreadful pain of choosing saving the world
  over family to the multilayered aspects of travelling through interstellar
  space, this movie does it all. It is number one on my list!
</p>
<h3>The Hangover</h3>
<p>
  A classic watch that will have in tears by the time you're finished. This film
  captures a bachelor party gone wrong...or right depending on your perspective.
</p>
<h3>White Chicks</h3>
<p>
  This is also a classic watch that has some of the funniest moments in comedy
  history. It may be the most rewatched comedy of all time.
